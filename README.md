# Dynamic-Token-Pruning-for-Efficient-CNN-ViT-Processing-on-CAMELYON16-Histopathology-Data
 Efficient histopathology classification on CAMELYON16 using a hybrid CNN-ViT model with dynamic token pruning. CNN heatmaps identify key regions, passing only relevant patches to the ViT, boosting speed and accuracy while reducing computation on large whole slide images.
